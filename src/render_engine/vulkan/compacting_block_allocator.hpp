     * \brief The memory allocator that Nova uses for mesh data
     *
     * Design goals:
     *  - Store mesh data in a single buffer to facilitate indirect rendering
     *  - Prioritize using less memory over runtime. Typical usage scenario for a game is loading a lot of resources
     *      when a new level is loaded, but not constantly loading more. Allocation speed isn't the primary concern
     *
     * Adapted from https://www.fasterthan.life/blog/2017/7/13/i-am-graphics-and-so-can-you-part-4- - I've changed it
     * to ration out parts of a buffer instead of allocating buffers from VkMemoryPools. I've also given it the ability
     * to compact allocations. If an allocation is requested and the total free space in the buffer is greater than or
     * equal to the size of the allocation, but there's no big enough contiguous blocks, memory will be moved to make
     * enough contiguous space
